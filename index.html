            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I am a 25 year old full stack devloper bootcamp student who is creating a web page for future employers to view in order to assess my ablilties and
                previous work. As I add more to my portfolio and skills, these sections will probably change with new applications and information. What I am typing right
                now is simply a place holder so I can see how it will look with a fully filled out section!
            </p>
            <p>
                Working on this weekly challenge has taught me many things, like how to use resources in order to utilize a tool correctly as well as where to look for those resources.
                I have also started to learn about my strengths and weaknessess. As a previous Computer Science student in university, I have plenty of practice with programming languages, comp-sci fundamentals,
                algorithms, and data structures. However, I am quickly learning that I don't have the best eye for visual design. I am not too happy with the appearence of my website, and I'm hoping through experience
                and practice I will be able to learn design fundamentals that are at least adequate.
