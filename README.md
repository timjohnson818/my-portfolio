# my-portfolio

## Description

For this weekly challenge we were tasked with creating a website that serves as a portfolio and display to potential employers.

-We had to meet certain requirements and techincal specifications

-It serves the purpose of the first wesite we built from scratch using the tools
we have learned in class

-I gained some proficiency in utilizing those tools as well as discovered some of my strengths and weaknesses

-I struggled with the creative portion of the project so I decided it was best to use something else as inspiration and in this case that was the example
website provided to us.

-The overall structure is based on that organization as well as a couple features such as the way the links in the navbar are animated when hovered over.

-The biggest source of learning came in the form of trying to replicate portions of the example and changing values of modifiers in order to gain a better
understanding of what they do and how to use them effectively.

-My only hope is that I didn't end up staying too close to the example so that I have potenially limited my growth by not trying more original ideas.

## Usage
--The cursor placed over the nav bar links will play a small animation and when clicked they will take to you that portion of the page, or link to an external resume (when that is available)

--Clicking on any of the images in the My Work section will take you to that application (For now the only work I have is Challenge 1)

--The github link in the Contact Me section will take you to my github page. 

--Shrinking the webpages width to below 980px will change the way the header is organized to maintain functionality and visual appeal.


## Credits

-I was still very thankful to the example as I feel I would have been very lost without it.
